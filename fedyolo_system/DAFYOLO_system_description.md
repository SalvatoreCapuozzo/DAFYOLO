# DAFYOLO — Disjoint Asynchronous Federated YOLO

## Abstract

DAFYOLO is a federated learning framework for multi-class object detection in
which participating nodes hold **disjoint subsets of class annotations** — a
common real-world constraint in distributed microscopy screening, where
different laboratory sites specialize in different parasite egg taxa. All
nodes start from **randomly initialized (blank) weights** and train on the
same visual domain. The resulting global model detects all classes jointly
without any node ever sharing its raw images.

The framework supports two aggregation strategies selectable via configuration:
a **synchronous baseline** (classic round-barrier FedAvg with class-conditional
aggregation) and the primary **asynchronous strategy** (immediate delta
aggregation with staleness discounting), which eliminates the synchronization
barrier and allows the global model to progress continuously as nodes submit
updates independently.

## 1. Problem Formulation

Let $\mathcal{C} = \{c_1, c_2, \dots, c_K\}$ be the global set of $K$ classes.
There are $N$ nodes. Node $i$ owns a class subset $\mathcal{C}_i \subsetneq \mathcal{C}$
such that every class is owned by at least one node:

$$\bigcup_{i=1}^{N} \mathcal{C}_i = \mathcal{C}$$

Subsets may be fully non-overlapping ($\mathcal{C}_i \cap \mathcal{C}_j = \emptyset$
for $i \neq j$) or partially overlapping. Node $i$ holds a local dataset
$\mathcal{D}_i$ of images annotated **only** for classes in $\mathcal{C}_i$.

The goal is to train a single global detector $f_\theta$ capable of detecting
all $K$ classes, without any node transmitting raw images or labels.

The central challenge is that a node with no annotation for class $c$ will,
if trained naively, treat every occurrence of $c$ in its images as background,
generating false-negative gradients that actively suppress $c$ in the global
model after aggregation.

## 2. Model Architecture

DAFYOLO uses a **YOLOv8** architecture (anchor-free, decoupled head) trained
from random initialization. The architecture choice is critical: the
**decoupled head** structure makes the per-class parameter decomposition exact.

### 2.1 Parameter Decomposition

Every weight tensor in the model falls into exactly one of two categories:

**Shared parameters** $\theta_\text{shared}$ — the entire feature extractor:
backbone (C2f blocks), neck (PAN-FPN), box-regression branch (`cv2`), DFL
layer, and the feature-mixing convolutions inside the classification branch
(`cv3.{i}.0`, `cv3.{i}.1`). These are class-agnostic: they produce feature
representations whose semantic content does not depend on which classes a node
owns.

**Per-class parameters** $\theta^{(c)}$ — the final 1×1 projection layer of
the classification branch at each of the $n_l$ detection scales:

$$\theta^{(c)} = \left\{
  \texttt{model.H.cv3.}i\texttt{.2.weight}[c,\,:\,,\,:\,,\,:],\;\;
  \texttt{model.H.cv3.}i\texttt{.2.bias}[c]
\right\}_{i=0}^{n_l - 1}$$

where $H$ is the index of the Detect module (last module in `model.model`).
The weight tensor at each scale has shape $(K, c_\text{inner}, 1, 1)$; row $c$
is the sole learned parameter that maps the inner feature dimension directly
to the logit for class $c$. This decomposition is verified programmatically
at runtime against the installed Ultralytics build.

## 3. Loss Masking

Each node $i$ trains with a **binary class mask**
$\mathbf{m}_i \in \{0,1\}^K$ where:

$$[\mathbf{m}_i]_c = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } c \in \mathcal{C}_i \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$

The per-class BCE classification loss is element-wise multiplied by
$\mathbf{m}_i$ before summing:

$$\mathcal{L}_\text{cls}^{(i)} = \sum_{c=1}^{K} [\mathbf{m}_i]_c \cdot \text{BCE}(\hat{p}_c, y_c)$$

This ensures a node with no annotation for class $c$ contributes **exactly
zero gradient** to the $c$-th output channel — neither pushing it toward
"object" (false positive risk) nor toward "background" (false negative risk).
The box regression and DFL losses are computed only for anchor assignments
that match a ground-truth box of an owned class.

## 4. Federated Aggregation Strategies

### 4.1 Synchronous Mode (FedServer)

The synchronous server implements a **round-barrier variant of FedAvg** with
class-conditional head aggregation. Each round $t$:

1. **Broadcast**: all nodes receive the current global model $\theta^{(t)}$.
2. **Local training**: every node independently trains for $E$ local epochs.
3. **Barrier**: the server waits until **all** $N$ nodes have submitted.
4. **Aggregate**:

**Shared layers** — sample-weighted FedAvg across all nodes:

$$\theta_\text{shared}^{(t+1)} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{|\mathcal{D}_i|}{\sum_j |\mathcal{D}_j|}\, \theta_{\text{shared},i}$$

**Per-class head** — for each class $c$, aggregate only among nodes that own $c$,
weighted by per-class instance count $n_i^{(c)}$:

$$\theta^{(c,t+1)} = \sum_{i:\, c \in \mathcal{C}_i} \frac{n_i^{(c)}}{\sum_{j:\, c \in \mathcal{C}_j} n_j^{(c)}}\, \theta_i^{(c)}$$

The global model version advances by 1 per round.

**Limitation**: the slowest node in each round blocks every other node.
In heterogeneous deployments (nodes with very different dataset sizes or
hardware) this creates systematic under-utilisation.

### 4.2 Asynchronous Mode (AsyncFedServer) — Primary Contribution

The asynchronous server eliminates the synchronization barrier entirely.
Each node runs independently in its own thread, cycling through:

$$\text{pull} \;\rightarrow\; \text{train} \;\rightarrow\; \text{push}$$

continuously for $T$ cycles. The server aggregates **immediately** upon each
push with no waiting for other nodes. The global model **version** $v$
increments by 1 after every single-node submission; total version count
equals $N \times T$.

#### 4.2.1 Staleness

Between the moment node $i$ pulls the model at version $v_\text{pull}$ and
the moment it submits its update, other nodes may have already submitted and
advanced the server to version $v_\text{now}$. The **staleness** of the
submission is:

$$s_i = v_\text{now} - v_\text{pull} \geq 0$$

A fresh submission has $s_i = 0$. A node that trained on a model that is
$s_i$ versions old contributes an update computed from outdated information.

#### 4.2.2 Staleness-Discounted Delta Aggregation

Rather than re-averaging all nodes (impossible with only one node submitting),
DAFYOLO uses an **implicit-gradient delta update** discounted by staleness.

Let $\Delta_i = \theta_i^\text{trained} - \theta^\text{pulled}$ be the
parameter displacement the node learned during local training. The server
applies this displacement to the **current** global model, discounted by a
staleness weight:

$$w_i = \frac{1}{1 + \alpha \cdot s_i}$$

where $\alpha$ is the `staleness_alpha` hyperparameter ($\alpha = 0$ disables
discounting; higher $\alpha$ penalizes stale updates more strongly).

**For shared layers**, the full delta is applied:

$$\theta_\text{shared}^{(v+1)} = \theta_\text{shared}^{(v)} + w_i \cdot \Delta_{\text{shared},i}$$

**For per-class layers**, the delta is applied channel-by-channel, only for
owned classes:

$$\theta^{(c,v+1)} = \begin{cases}
\theta^{(c,v)} + w_i \cdot \Delta_i^{(c)} & \text{if } c \in \mathcal{C}_i \\
\theta^{(c,v)} & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

This is the key property: a node that doesn't own class $c$ leaves
$\theta^{(c)}$ **exactly unchanged**, regardless of what its local training
did to that channel.

#### 4.2.3 Convergence Properties

The delta update is equivalent to performing one step of asynchronous
stochastic gradient descent in parameter space, where each node's "gradient"
is its full local parameter update and the step size is $w_i$. Under standard
assumptions on gradient variance and diminishing staleness (which hold when
$\alpha > 0$ bounds $w_i$ away from 1 for stale updates), async-SGD-style
methods converge to a neighbourhood of the true optimum. In practice,
$\alpha = 0.5$ gives good empirical behaviour: a submission at staleness 1
receives weight 0.667 (vs. 1.0 for a fresh submission), and at staleness 5
receives weight 0.286.

## 5. Cross-Round Pseudo-Labeling

Starting at cycle index `start_round` (per-node), each node optionally
applies **cross-round self-distillation** for classes it does not own.

In **sync mode**, the teacher is the previous round's global model.
In **async mode**, the teacher is the global snapshot the node pulled at
the start of its current cycle (the model it started training from).

For each batch, the teacher is run in inference mode over the same images.
At anchor positions where the teacher is confident for an unowned class $c$
(sigmoid score $> \tau$ or $< 1-\tau$, where $\tau$ = `conf_thresh`), a
binary cross-entropy distillation loss is added:

$$\mathcal{L}_\text{distill}^{(i)} = \lambda \cdot \frac{1}{|\mathcal{A}^\tau|}
  \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}^\tau} \sum_{c \notin \mathcal{C}_i}
  \text{BCE}\!\left(\hat{p}_{a,c},\; \sigma(z^\text{teacher}_{a,c})\right)$$

where $\mathcal{A}^\tau$ is the set of confident anchor positions and
$\lambda$ = `pseudo_label.weight`. This requires no NMS or box decoding and
works directly on the dense anchor grid. Its effect is to let information
about classes a node has never seen propagate into that node's backbone, once
the global model is reliable enough to trust.

## 6. Training Stability

Training YOLO from random initialization (no pretrained transfer) is prone
to large gradient spikes on the first few batches because predicted box
coordinates and class logits start essentially arbitrary. Two mechanisms are
applied:

**Per-round/cycle LR warmup**: a linear ramp from $0$ to $\eta_0$ over the
first `warmup_steps` gradient steps. This matters in both modes because each
round/cycle reloads the global state dict into a fresh optimizer (momentum
and variance estimates restart from zero).

**Gradient norm clipping**: gradients are clipped to a maximum L2 norm of
`grad_clip` (default 10.0) before each optimizer step.

**Image resolution note**: validated empirically — at `imgsz` $\leq 192$
pixels, the classifier head converges to predicting "background" at every
anchor even after 100+ epochs on this task. At `imgsz` $= 256$ the same
setup converges cleanly. The feature maps are too coarse at low resolution
for the anchor-object overlap to produce reliable positive assignments for
small objects. Use at least 256 pixels; 640 pixels for real microscopy data.

---

## 7. Evaluation

The global model is evaluated on a **pooled validation set**: all nodes'
validation splits are merged into a single dataset, with label files rewritten
to use global class ids. Evaluation uses Ultralytics' standard
`DetectionValidator` pipeline directly, so mAP numbers are computed with the
same NMS and IoU-matching logic as any standard YOLO benchmark.

The **centralized baseline** trains one model directly over the union of all
nodes' images, with the same per-node class masking (since a node's images
genuinely lack ground-truth for unowned classes regardless of whether training
is federated). This isolates the cost of federation from the cost of
partial labels, which both approaches face equally.
